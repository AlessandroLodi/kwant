kwant is a Python package for numerical quantum transport calculations.  It
aims to be an user-friendly, powerful and efficient toolbox for the simulation
of physical systems (of any dimensionality) that can be described by a
tight-binding model.  It offers direct support for calculations of Landauer
transport (conductance, noise), dispersion relations, modes, wave functions,
various Green's functions, and local density of states.  Being extensible and
modular, kwant has been designed to be useful for other computations involving
tight-binding Hamiltonians as well.
