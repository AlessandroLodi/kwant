Kwant is a Python package for numerical quantum transport calculations. It aims
to be an user-friendly, universal, and high-performance toolbox for the
simulation of physical systems of any dimensionality and geometry that can be
described by a tight-binding model. Kwant has been designed such that the
natural concepts of the theory of quantum transport (lattices, symmetries,
electrodes, orbital/spin/electron-hole degrees of freedom) are exposed in a
simple and transparent way: Defining a new simulation setup is very close to
describing the corresponding mathematical model. Kwant offers direct support for
calculations of transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix),
dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various Greenâ€™s functions, and
out-of-equilibrium local quantities (charge or current densities). Other
computations involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented easily
thanks to its extensible and modular nature.
