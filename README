kwant is a Python package for numerical quantum transport calculations.  It
aims to be an user-friendly, powerful and efficient toolbox for the simulation
of physical systems governed by tight-binding Hamiltonians.  It is currently
suitable for calculations of Landauer transport (conductance, noise),
dispersion relations, modes, wavefunctions, various Green functions, local
density of states.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions and LICENSE for legal
information.  Complete reference documentation and a tutorial are also
available.
