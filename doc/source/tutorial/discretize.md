Discretizing continuous Hamiltonians
====================================

Introduction
------------

In \"[tutorial\_discretization\_schrodinger]{role="ref"}\" we have
learnt that Kwant works with tight-binding Hamiltonians. Often, however,
one will start with a continuum model and will subsequently need to
discretize it to arrive at a tight-binding model. Although discretizing
a Hamiltonian is usually a simple process, it is tedious and repetitive.
The situation is further exacerbated when one introduces additional
on-site degrees of freedom, and tracking all the necessary terms becomes
a chore. The `~kwant.continuum` sub-package aims to be a solution
to this problem. It is a collection of tools for working with continuum
models and for discretizing them into tight-binding models.

Discretizing by hand {#tutorial_discretizer_introduction}
--------------------

As an example, let us consider the following continuum Schr√∂dinger
equation for a semiconducting heterostructure (using the effective mass
approximation):

$$\left( k_x \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m(x)} k_x \right) \psi(x) = E \, \psi(x).$$

Replacing the momenta by their corresponding differential operators

$$k_\alpha = -i \partial_\alpha,$$

for $\alpha = x, y$ or $z$, and discretizing on a regular lattice of
points with spacing $a$, we obtain the tight-binding model

$$H = - \frac{1}{a^2} \sum_i A\left(x+\frac{a}{2}\right)
        \big(\ket{i}\bra{i+1} + h.c.\big)
    + \frac{1}{a^2} \sum_i
        \left( A\left(x+\frac{a}{2}\right) + A\left(x-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right)
        \ket{i} \bra{i},$$

with $A(x) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m(x)}$.

First we must explicitly import the `kwant.continuum` package:

import kwant
import kwant.continuum

```

The function `kwant.continuum.discretize` takes a symbolic
Hamiltonian and turns it into a `~kwant.builder.Builder` instance
with appropriate spatial symmetry that serves as a template. (We will
see how to use the template to build systems with a particular shape
later).

```python



def main():
    template = kwant.continuum.discretize('k_x * A(x) * k_x')
    print(template)


    syst = stadium_system()
    plot_eigenstate(syst)

    analyze_qsh()
    lattice_spacing()
    substitutions()

# Call the main function if the script gets executed (as opposed to imported).
# See <http://docs.python.org/library/__main__.html>.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

It is worth noting that ``discretize`` treats ``k_x`` and ``x`` as
non-commuting operators, and so their order is preserved during the
discretization process.

The builder produced by ``discretize`` may be printed to show the source
code of its onsite and hopping functions (this is a special feature of
builders returned by ``discretize``):

::: {.specialnote}
Technical details

-   ``kwant.continuum`` uses ``sympy`` internally to handle symbolic
    expressions. Strings are converted using
    `kwant.continuum.sympify`, which essentially applies some
    Kwant-specific rules (such as treating ``k_x`` and ``x`` as
    non-commutative) before calling ``sympy.sympify``
-   The builder returned by ``discretize`` will have an N-D translational
    symmetry, where ``N`` is the number of dimensions that were
    discretized. This is the case, even if there are expressions in the
    input (e.g. ``V(x, y)``) which in principle *may not* have this
    symmetry. When using the returned builder directly, or when using it
    as a template to construct systems with different/lower symmetry, it
    is important to ensure that any functional parameters passed to the
    system respect the symmetry of the system. Kwant provides no
    consistency check for this.
-   The discretization process consists of taking input
    $H(k_x, k_y, k_z)$, multiplying it from the right by $\psi(x, y, z)$
    and iteratively applying a second-order accurate central derivative
    approximation for every $k_\alpha=-i\partial_\alpha$:

    $$\partial_\alpha \psi(\alpha) =
    \frac{1}{a} \left( \psi\left(\alpha + \frac{a}{2}\right)
    -\psi\left(\alpha - \frac{a}{2}\right)\right).$$

    This process is done separately for every summand in Hamiltonian.
    Once all symbols denoting operators are applied internal algorithm
    is calculating ``gcd`` for hoppings coming from each summand in order
    to find best possible approximation. Please see source code for
    details.

-   Instead of using ``discretize`` one can use
    `~kwant.continuum.discretize\_symbolic` to obtain symbolic
    output. When working interactively in [Jupyter
    notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) it can be useful to use this to see
    a symbolic representation of the discretized Hamiltonian. This works
    best when combined with ``sympy`` [Pretty
    Printing](http://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/printing.html#setting-up-pretty-printing).
-   The symbolic result of discretization obtained with
    ``discretize_symbolic`` can be converted into a builder using
    `~kwant.continuum.build\_discretized`. This can be useful if
    one wants to alter the tight-binding Hamiltonian before building the
    system.
:::

Building a Kwant system from the template
-----------------------------------------

Let us now use the output of ``discretize`` as a template to build a
system and plot some of its energy eigenstate. For this example the
Hamiltonian will be

$$H = k_x^2 + k_y^2 + V(x, y),$$

where $V(x, y)$ is some arbitrary potential.

First, use ``discretize`` to obtain a builder that we will use as a
template:

```python

import scipy.sparse.linalg
import scipy.linalg
import numpy as np

# For plotting
import matplotlib as mpl
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


def stadium_system(L=20, W=20):
    hamiltonian = "k_x**2 + k_y**2 + V(x, y)"
    template = kwant.continuum.discretize(hamiltonian)
    print(template)

```

We now use this system with the `~kwant.builder.Builder.fill`
method of `~kwant.builder.Builder` to construct the system we
want to investigate:

```python


    def stadium(site):
        (x, y) = site.pos
        x = max(abs(x) - 20, 0)
        return x**2 + y**2 < 30**2

    syst = kwant.Builder()
    syst.fill(template, stadium, (0, 0));
    syst = syst.finalized()

```

After finalizing this system, we can plot one of the system's energy
eigenstates:

```python

    return syst


def plot_eigenstate(syst, n=2, Vx=.0003, Vy=.0005):

    def potential(x, y):
        return Vx * x + Vy * y

    ham = syst.hamiltonian_submatrix(params=dict(V=potential), sparse=True)
    evecs = scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh(ham, k=10, which='SM')[1]
    kwant.plotter.map(syst, abs(evecs[:, n])**2, show=False)

```

![image](/code/figure/discretizer_gs.*)

Note in the above that we provided the function ``V`` to
``syst.hamiltonian_submatrix`` using ``params=dict(V=potential)``, rather
than via ``args``.

In addition, the function passed as ``V`` expects two input parameters ``x``
and ``y``, the same as in the initial continuum Hamiltonian.

Models with more structure: Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang
-------------------------------------------------

When working with multi-band systems, like the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang
(BHZ) model[^1][^2], one can provide matrix input to
`~kwant.continuum.discretize` using ``identity`` and ``kron``. For
example, the definition of the BHZ model can be written succinctly as:

```python

    plt.show()


def qsh_system(a=20, L=2000, W=1000):
    hamiltonian = """
       + C * identity(4) + M * kron(sigma_0, sigma_z)
       - B * (k_x**2 + k_y**2) * kron(sigma_0, sigma_z)
       - D * (k_x**2 + k_y**2) * kron(sigma_0, sigma_0)
       + A * k_x * kron(sigma_z, sigma_x)
       - A * k_y * kron(sigma_0, sigma_y)
    """

    template = kwant.continuum.discretize(hamiltonian, grid=a)

```

We can then make a ribbon out of this template system:

```python


    def shape(site):
        (x, y) = site.pos
        return (0 <= y < W and 0 <= x < L)

    def lead_shape(site):
        (x, y) = site.pos
        return (0 <= y < W)

    syst = kwant.Builder()
    syst.fill(template, shape, (0, 0))

    lead = kwant.Builder(kwant.TranslationalSymmetry([-a, 0]))
    lead.fill(template, lead_shape, (0, 0))

    syst.attach_lead(lead)
    syst.attach_lead(lead.reversed())

    syst = syst.finalized()

```

and plot its dispersion using `kwant.plotter.bands`:

```python

    return syst


def analyze_qsh():
    params = dict(A=3.65, B=-68.6, D=-51.1, M=-0.01, C=0)
    syst = qsh_system()

    kwant.plotter.bands(syst.leads[0], params=params,
                        momenta=np.linspace(-0.3, 0.3, 201), show=False)

```

![image](/code/figure/discretizer_qsh_band.*)

In the above we see the edge states of the quantum spin Hall effect,
which we can visualize using `kwant.plotter.map`:

```python


    plt.grid()
    plt.xlim(-.3, 0.3)
    plt.ylim(-0.05, 0.05)
    plt.xlabel('momentum [1/A]')
    plt.ylabel('energy [eV]')
    plt.show()
    # get scattering wave functions at E=0
    wf = kwant.wave_function(syst, energy=0, params=params)

    # prepare density operators
    sigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])
    prob_density = kwant.operator.Density(syst, np.eye(4))
    spin_density = kwant.operator.Density(syst, np.kron(sigma_z, np.eye(2)))

    # calculate expectation values and plot them
    wf_sqr = sum(prob_density(psi) for psi in wf(0))  # states from left lead
    rho_sz = sum(spin_density(psi) for psi in wf(0))  # states from left lead

    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True, figsize=(16, 4))
    kwant.plotter.map(syst, wf_sqr, ax=ax1)
    kwant.plotter.map(syst, rho_sz, ax=ax2)

```

Limitations of discretization
-----------------------------

It is important to remember that the discretization of a continuum model
is an *approximation* that is only valid in the low-energy limit. For
example, the quadratic continuum Hamiltonian

$$H_\textrm{continuous}(k_x) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}k_x^2$$

and its discretized approximation

$$H_\textrm{tight-binding}(k_x) = 2t \big(1 - \cos(k_x a)\big),$$

where $t=\frac{\hbar^2}{2ma^2}$, are only valid in the limit $E < t$.
The grid spacing $a$ must be chosen according to how high in energy you
need your tight-binding model to be valid.

It is possible to set $a$ through the ``grid`` parameter to
`~kwant.continuum.discretize`, as we will illustrate in the
following example. Let us start from the continuum Hamiltonian

$$H(k) = k_x^2 \mathbb{1}_{2\times2} + Œ± k_x \sigma_y.$$

We start by defining this model as a string and setting the value of the
$Œ±$ parameter:

```python

    ax = ax1
    im = [obj for obj in ax.get_children()
          if isinstance(obj, mpl.image.AxesImage)][0]
    fig.colorbar(im, ax=ax)

    ax = ax2
    im = [obj for obj in ax.get_children()
          if isinstance(obj, mpl.image.AxesImage)][0]
    fig.colorbar(im, ax=ax)

    ax1.set_title('Probability density')
    ax2.set_title('Spin density')
    plt.show()


def lattice_spacing():
    hamiltonian = "k_x**2 * identity(2) + alpha * k_x * sigma_y"
    params = dict(alpha=.5)

```

Now we can use `kwant.continuum.lambdify` to obtain a function
that computes $H(k)$:

```python


    def plot(ax, a=1):
        h_k = kwant.continuum.lambdify(hamiltonian, locals=params)
        k_cont = np.linspace(-4, 4, 201)
        e_cont = [scipy.linalg.eigvalsh(h_k(k_x=ki)) for ki in k_cont]

```

We can also construct a discretized approximation using
`kwant.continuum.discretize`, in a similar manner to previous
examples:

```python


        template = kwant.continuum.discretize(hamiltonian, grid=a)
        syst = kwant.wraparound.wraparound(template).finalized()

        def h_k(k_x):
            p = dict(k_x=k_x, **params)
            return syst.hamiltonian_submatrix(params=p)

        k_tb = np.linspace(-np.pi/a, np.pi/a, 201)
        e_tb = [scipy.linalg.eigvalsh(h_k(k_x=a*ki)) for ki in k_tb]

```

Below we can see the continuum and tight-binding dispersions for two
different values of the discretization grid spacing $a$:

![image](/code/figure/discretizer_lattice_spacing.*)

We clearly see that the smaller grid spacing is, the better we
approximate the original continuous dispersion. It is also worth
remembering that the Brillouin zone also scales with grid spacing:
$[-\frac{\pi}{a},
\frac{\pi}{a}]$.

Advanced topics
---------------

The input to `kwant.continuum.discretize` and
`kwant.continuum.lambdify` can be not only a ``string``, as we saw
above, but also a ``sympy`` expression or a ``sympy`` matrix. This
functionality will probably be mostly useful to people who are already
experienced with ``sympy``.

It is possible to use ``identity`` (for identity matrix), ``kron`` (for
Kronecker product), as well as Pauli matrices ``sigma_0``, ``sigma_x``,
``sigma_y``, ``sigma_z`` in the input to `~kwant.continuum.lambdify`
and `~kwant.continuum.discretize`, in order to simplify
expressions involving matrices. Matrices can also be provided explicitly
using square ``[]`` brackets. For example, all following expressions are
equivalent:

```python


        ax.plot(k_cont, e_cont, 'r-')
        ax.plot(k_tb, e_tb, 'k-')

        ax.plot([], [], 'r-', label='continuum')
        ax.plot([], [], 'k-', label='tight-binding')

        ax.set_xlim(-4, 4)
        ax.set_ylim(-1, 14)
        ax.set_title('a={}'.format(a))

        ax.set_xlabel('momentum [a.u.]')
        ax.set_ylabel('energy [a.u.]')
        ax.grid()
        ax.legend()

    _, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True, figsize=(12, 4))

    plot(ax1, a=1)
    plot(ax2, a=.25)
    plt.show()


def substitutions():
    sympify = kwant.continuum.sympify
    subs = {'sx': [[0, 1], [1, 0]], 'sz': [[1, 0], [0, -1]]}

    e = (
        sympify('[[k_x**2, alpha * k_x], [k_x * alpha, -k_x**2]]'),
        sympify('k_x**2 * sigma_z + alpha * k_x * sigma_x'),
        sympify('k_x**2 * sz + alpha * k_x * sx', locals=subs),
    )

    print(e[0] == e[1] == e[2])

```

We can use the ``locals`` keyword parameter to substitute expressions and
numerical values:

```python


    subs = {'A': 'A(x) + B', 'V': 'V(x) + V_0', 'C': 5}
    print(sympify('k_x * A * k_x + V + C', locals=subs))

```

::: {.literalinclude}
/code/figure/discretizer\_subs\_2.txt
:::

Symbolic expressions obtained in this way can be directly passed to all
``discretizer`` functions.

::: {.specialnote}
Technical details

Because of the way that ``sympy`` handles commutation relations all
symbols representing position and momentum operators are set to be non
commutative. This means that the order of momentum and position
operators in the input expression is preserved. Note that it is not
possible to define individual commutation relations within ``sympy``, even
expressions such $x k_y x$ will not be simplified, even though
mathematically $[x, k_y] = 0$.
