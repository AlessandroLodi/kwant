What's New in kwant 0.3
=======================

This article explains the user-visible changes in kwant 0.3.

Immutable site groups
---------------------
In order to make naming more consistent, `kwant.make_lattice` was renamed and
can be found now as `~kwant.lattice.general`. Classes `Chain`, `Square`, and
`Honeycomb` from `~kwant.lattice` were made functions `~kwant.lattice.chain`,
`~kwant.lattice.square`, and `~kwant.lattice.honeycomb`.

In previous versions if one executed `a = kwant.lattice.square();
b = kwant.lattice.square()` then `a` and `b` were
actually different lattices. This often led to confusions in more convoluted
use cases, so this behavior was changed. Now two site groups created with the
same parameters are actually indistinguishable by `kwant`. If it is desired to
make two site groups which have the same geometry, but mean different things,
as for instance in :doc:`../tutorial/tutorial5`, then the `name` argument has
to be used when creating a lattice, e.g. `a = kwant.lattice.square(name='a');
b = kwant.lattice.square(name='b')`.
