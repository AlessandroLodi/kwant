What's New in kwant 0.2
=======================

This article explains the user-visible changes in kwant 0.2.

`~kwant.plotter.plot` more useful for low level systems
-------------------------------------------------------
The behavior of `~kwant.plotter.plot` has been changed when a `low level system
<kwant.system.System>` is plotted.  Previously, only low level systems which
were finalized `builders <kwant.builder.Builder>` were supported and there was
no difference between plotting a low-level system and a builder.

* Arguments of plot which are functions are given site numbers in place of
  `~kwant.builder.Site` objects when plotting a low level system.  This
  provides an easy way to make the appearance of lines and symbols depend on
  computation results.

* Only the scattering region (without leads) is plotted for low level systems.

* For plotting low level systems, dictionaries with site group keys are no
  longer supported as plot arguments.

Calculation of the local density of states
------------------------------------------
The new function `kwant.solvers.sparse.ldos` allows the calculation of the
local density of states.

Plotting of functions of system sites
-------------------------------------
The new function `kwant.plotter.show` plots functions of the system, i.e. the
potential or the LDOS.

Return value of sparse solver
-----------------------------
`kwant.solvers.sparse.solve` now always returns a single instance of
`~kwant.solvers.sparse.BlockResult`.  The latter has been generalized to
include more information for leads defined as infinite systems.

Return value of `~kwant.system.System.hamiltonian_submatrix`
------------------------------------------------------------
`~kwant.system.System.hamiltonian_submatrix` now always returns a 3-tuple
``hamiltonian_part, to_norb, from_norb``.

Return value of `~kwant.solvers.sparse.make_linear_sys` has changed
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A namedtuple is used for more clarity.
