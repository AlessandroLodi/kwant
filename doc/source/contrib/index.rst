:mod:`kwant.contrib` -- Contributed modules
===========================================

.. module:: kwant.contrib

Although this collection of modules is available as part of the official kwant
distribution, it is not considered to be an integral part of kwant.  The
intention is to keep interesting modules that are useful with kwant here (maybe
even experimental ones) to give users an easier access to them, and to give them
wider exposure, so that they can be improved faster.  Users of kwant are welcome
to submit their own modules for inclusion in :mod:`kwant.contrib`.

For simplicity, all contributions share the same license as kwant.  (This
requirement may be relaxed to allow other free licenses if requested.)
