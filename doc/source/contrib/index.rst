Contributed modules
===================

.. module:: kwant.contrib

:mod:`kwant.contrib` is a collection of independent modules that is part of the
official kwant distribution, but is not considered to be an integral part of
kwant.  The intention is to keep interesting modules that are useful with kwant
here (maybe even experimental ones) to give users an easier access to them, and
them wider exposure.  Users of kwant are welcome to submit their own modules for
inclusion.

For simplicity, all contributions share the same license as kwant.  (This
requirement may be relaxed to allow other free licenses if requested.)
