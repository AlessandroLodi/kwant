What's new in Kwant 1.1
=======================

This article explains the user-visible changes in Kwant 1.1.

Harmonize `~kwant.physics.Bands` with `~kwant.physics.modes`
------------------------------------------------------------
Kwant's convention is that momenta are positive in the direction of
`~kwant.lattice.TranslationalSymmetry`.  While the momenta returned by
`~kwant.physics.modes` did respect this convention, the momenta read off the
band structure as given by `~kwant.physics.Bands` had the wrong sign.  This has
been fixed now.
