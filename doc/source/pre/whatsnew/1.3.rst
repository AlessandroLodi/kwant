Sites in finalized builders have consistent ordering
----------------------------------------------------
In Python 3 the internal ordering of dictionaries is not deterministic. This
meant that running a Kwant script twice would produce systems with different
ordering of sites, which lead to non-reproducible calculations. Now, sites
in finalized builders are always ordered first by their site family, then by
their tag.

Coincidentally, this means that you can plot a wavefunction in a simple 1D
system by just saying::

    lattice_1D = chain()
    syst = make_system(lattice_1D)
    h = syst.hamiltonian_submatrix()
    pyplot.plot(np.eigs(h)[1][0])
