What's new in Kwant 1.4
=======================

This article explains the user-visible changes in Kwant 1.4.0.
See also the `full list of changes up to the most recent bugfix
release of the 1.4 series
<https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/kwant/compare/v1.4.0...latest-1.4>`_.

Configurable maximum velocity in stream plots
---------------------------------------------
The function `~kwant.plotter.streamplot` has got a new option ``vmax``.  Note
that this option is not available in `~kwant.plotter.current`.  In order to use
it, one has to call ``streamplot`` directly as shown in the docstring of
``current``.

Improved heuristic for colorscale limits in `kwant.plotter.map`
---------------------------------------------------------------
Previously `~kwant.plotter.map` would set the limits for the color scale
to the extrema of the data being plotted when ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` were
not provided. This is the behaviour of ``matplotlib.imshow``. When the data
to be plotted has very sharp and high peaks this would mean that most of the
data would appear near the bottom of the color scale, and all of the features
would be washed out by the presence of the peak. Now `~kwant.plotter.map`
employs a heuristic for setting the colorscale when there are outliers,
and will emit a warning when this is detected.
