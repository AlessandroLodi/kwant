release of the 1.4 series

Configurable maximum velocity in stream plots
---------------------------------------------
The function `~kwant.plotter.streamplot` has got a new option ``vmax``.  Note
that this option is not available in `~kwant.plotter.current`.  In order to use
it, one has to call ``streamplot`` directly as shown in the docstring of
``current``.
